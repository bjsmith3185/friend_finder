# friend_finder


Friend finder uses node.js and express.js

The program prompts a user to enter their information along with numeric values to questions and returns a friend.

- Home page allows the user to begin the quesitons or to view the entire list of friends already stored

- The questions page will prompt the user to enter
    - first name, last name, upload a picture, select numeric values to questions.
        ( there are some default image links for testing)
    - once the user clicks submit, the data is analized and and the closest match is displayed in a modal
    - the modal can be closed taking the user back to the home page

- The friends page will show a list of all users stored.


- this program is stored on github and deployed to heroku.



note:
- question_practice.html, questionsModal.html, style.css, practice.js are not used in the program. They will be deleted after I attempte a few upgrades.
